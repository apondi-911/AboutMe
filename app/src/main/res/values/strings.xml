        \nI am turning 21 this year.
        \n\nI am a 3rd year student from Meru University of Science and technology
        \nI am pursuing a degree course in computer science.
        \n\nMy interest in this field of IT is graphics Design and Programming.
        \n\nMy vision is that a few years to come I\'ll have acquired a job \nand earning from it.
        \n\nI love watching series rather than movies.
        \n\nI love enjoyment and listening to afro beats.\nDancing, drawing and singing are my hobbies.
        \n\nI am the firstborn in my family which gives me the push to work hard everyday.
        \n\nI am the only girl followed by two brothers. I want to give them the best in this life.
        \n\nMy motivator is my dad,we talk alot as compared to how I talk with momz.
        \n\nI am more of a loner but I do know how to socialize with people.
        \n\nDamn I love fashion, I mean when it comes to dressing well I never disappoint.
        \n\nMy circle of friends is small and they all crazy but I love them.
        \n\nRecently I started loving cats,I mean this was not so me.\nI used to hate them until I
        found a cat has given birth to beautiful kittens in our balcony.\n\nDamn they were so cute and I got attached
        to them.
        \n\nOne thing about me is I love working,I love doing things that make me busy.\nI don\'t like being idle.
        \n\nI have so much to say about me, but will add next time.
